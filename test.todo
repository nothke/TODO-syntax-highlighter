====== TODO syntax highlighting for Sublime =======
== header surrounded with at least 2 equal signs ==

- Stuff you can do
	- normal point
	- another normal point
	= yellowy point, equals sign - working on it now (this regex catches everything)
	= asdoiajsod
	- something questionable ?? hmmm..? double question mark for questions/undecided ??
	# very  important, or do next, or completed (cause it's green)
	- < problem in wedges >
	- [[ a really bad problem in double brackets ]] ?? or extremely important eye catchingly thing ??
	- // completed point, basically a line comment

- Alternative form - the Auston way
	[ ] not done
	[x] done

- Some more ideas
	- | orange italic text between bars |
	- ** bold markup, n/a in other themes **
	- _italic thing between lowlines (can't remember how they're called in english), n/a in other themes_
	- { purplish thing in braces }
